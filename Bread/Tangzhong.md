## Tangzhong

*Ingredients*
* 620 g bread flour
* 200 g water
* 60 g sugar
* 12 g salt
* 10 g dry yeast
* 10 g dry milk
* 260 g milk
* 50 g eggâ‹…
* 50 g unsalted butter (room temp)
* 2 TBSP milk or heavy cream

**Use a dough hook**
1. To create the tangzhong combine 40 g of bread flour and 200 g water in saucepan. Keep on medium heat and stir constantly for about 10 minutes until mixture thickens and becomes almost elastic, pulling off the bottom of the pan as you mix. 
2. Refridgerate tangzhong mixture for 6 hours
3. Combine rest of bread flour, sugar, salt, dry yeast, and dry milk into a mixer on low. 
4. Add milk, egg, and tangzhong
5. Once mixture has somewhat come together, add butter
6. Raise speed and mix until dough becomes elastic (you can perform a window test to check if your dough is ready by pulling off a little dough and thinly stretching it between your finger, hold it up and if the dough can let in light without tearing it's done)
7. Remove dough and shape into ball, placing it into a bowl and covering the top with cling wrap. Let rise for 40 min ~ 1 hr.
8. Punch dough lightly to deflate it and cut into 6 equal parts
9. Shape each portion into a small ball and wrap in plastic wrap, letting it rise for 15 min
10. Roll out each ball into a long oblong and fold into thirds
11. Turn 90 degrees and seam side up, roll into a cylindrical shape, pinching the dough seams together as you go
12. Repeat this 5 more times and place 3 rolls per bread tin
14. Cover and let rise for 30 min
15. Mix one large egg and two tablespoons of heavy cream or milk and brush onto top of loaf
16. Bake for 25 min at 355 F (180 C)
